# Forget Me Nots
Hey there! These are my personal notes to keep track of useful stuff I picked along the way. Here you'll mostly find Python, SQL and Mathematics ðŸ¤“

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **Blog Posts** (`/blog`) - Problem solving instructions and personal recollections
- **Notes** (`/notes`) - Snippets of code, and cheatsheets for quick reference
- **WIP** (`/wip`) - Incomplete stuff, mostly not working!

## Why?
- **Public** - I believe in sharing information. Most of my accomplishments come from open source and public information
- **Code repo** - Most of the times I want to save code snippets, and I want to edit them later, so having version control helps
- **Github** - I can write and read it anywhere, and gives the readers a chance to leave their opinions as issues, or suggest changes in a PR - Please, do share your opinions and corrections!
